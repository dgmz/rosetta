# Rosetta
Same code in multiple languages


# Goals

The goals for this project is to develop a *moderately* complex code in a few 
languages. This may serve to objectively compare these languages in real use,
in terms of readability, expressivity or performance.

The project to implement is the first lessons of excellent Dmity Sokolov's 
[tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0:-getting-started), an small 3D software renderer.

Unlike Dmitry, I will be using no external libraries, in order to keep the code
portable.
